### Hello! I'm Stéphane. 👋

I write code for the **[Spring Engineering Team](https://spring.io/team)**.

I've been working with Spring for a long time, transitioning from a user, to a contributor, and finally to a maintainer. I know how complex software development can be, so I try to focus my efforts on simplifying that journey for others.

To me, open source is about more than just pull requests; it's about the people behind the screen. I am deeply committed to making sure our community is a place where diverse voices are heard and where new contributors feel safe to ask questions.

Let's build something cool together. 🍃
